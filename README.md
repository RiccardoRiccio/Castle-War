## Introduction

Castle War is a 2D game created using the Pygame library. The game is played in real-time by two players sharing the same keyboard and screen, and the goal is to destroy the enemy wall using different troops such as swordsmen, workers, and archers. Each player has a wall that must be protected, a tower that attacks enemy units, a barracks that can train or release troops, and a mine that generates new resources.

This repository contains the source code and project report for Castle War.
